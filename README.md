# iRoute
### Simulate persistent static routes!
Since iOS does not have any settings regarding static routes, and the package `Network Commands` includes a `route` command that lacks support for persistent routes I decided to build this tool.

I, personally, use it to have access to my home lab, while at home, without having to connect to the VPN server.
